- Unit and End to End Testing.

- Improve, document and implement the eslint rules in order to:
  
  - Define the code styling of the project and have clear consistent coding conventions

  - Maintain the code quality with ease

- Add Git Hooks to enforce and ensure the selected coding conventions and the quality of the app (tests)
  




## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).
